# Sign_Up_Page
It is a signup Page created by using HTML, CSS, Javascript.
Html and Css are for frontend and i used javascript for validating the form and teeling user if there is a problem in filling of the form.
It has now some restrictions for validating the form:

-->Username cannot be blank and has at least 3 characters and cannot be longer than 25 characters.
-->Every Field is mandatory.
-->Used regex for validating the Email.
-->The confirm password must be the same as the password.

As soon as user is not able to validate message appears below the field telling what is the problem.

If the form is validated than it redirects to a 'Thank you Page!'
